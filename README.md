# The Human Market

The Human Market is a tool for funding vegan communities activism in different communnities around the world.

The goal of this project is to make an online market for all vegan products, restaurants, food, services, artisans, entrepreneurs of the city to be locally searchable, and be able to get paid completely by crypto on a parallel market.

Using tools like Glovo and some clever design on code for managing deliveries, we can create a fully autonomous market.

Each market could set a % charged to companies to withdrawal the money gotten from the market. The profits from this manuever can then be redirected to local nonprofit organizations that promote veganism. With this, we can create a virtuous cycle of funding, as veganism is popularized, the market grows and the organizations grow stronger.

Vegans should be able to buy all their basic neccesities of food and sanitation through the market, so if we charge 10% for every sale, and people spend on average US$ 50 per month, we raise US$ 5 per person per month. With 10,000 vegans buying all the food from the market, we'll be raising US$ 50,000 every month that's going to go to LOCAL activists organizations.

I truly believe this is the way to go to build an agorist society. On the future, we might start funding all kinds of organiztaions that will slowly replace the role of the government, and take away it's power, as we gain people's support.

## How it works?

Each community gets their own subdomain on VeganoMercado.org (future domain name subject change).

Each community activists gets their own community on Matrix.org

Each community organization registers on OpenCollective.com

Each community activists gets to vote how much funding and for what each organization should receive.

When vegans in the city buy all their food on the market, all the market profits go to the voted funding.

We use the money and Matrix coordination and strenghten the groups, and promote the use of the market among vegans, both by gaining new users, and by finding new providers and entrepreneurs. We also promote the market itself to non-vegans.

The Matrix community should also be open to vegan entrepreneurs and anyone who wants to make proposal, contribute ideas, or start their own organization.

We start organizing regular public activism fairs around the city, with talks and information given by activists groups. Maybe also combining it with the gastronomic vegan fairs, to get more people. Hopefully we can get people want to get involved, which makes the city a better place.
