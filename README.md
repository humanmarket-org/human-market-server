# The Human Market

Ok, first before you try to understand what this is, [read this essay](https://thenextsystem.org/community-democracy-mutual-aid), once you’ve done it and you understand what is the endgoal, continue reading.

## How it works

The Human Market is a blockchain-based decentralized market and democratic tool. Using the power of the Stellar crypto-currency, which has many technical and pratical advantages over other ones like Bitcoins.

Crypto addresses are used as wallets for all members. Members can create or join democracies, companies, and non-profit organizations, all registered on the decentralized ledger.

By the use of smart contracts we can allow democracies or company owners to control the money of group-owned wallets.

Each individual on a democracy can vote by crafting a list of the institutions (non-profit organizations) that they want to fund with their taxes. Whenever they make a transaction from their address, a small fee goes to funding these institutions from priority order.

If an institution is selected by 50% of the democracy, then the intitution is selected for suggested funding. When this happens, everyone in the democracy is automatically opted in into supporting the institution, and people that don’t want to, have to manually opt-out (but they can). Additionally, companies that are registered in that democracy, also start to automatically contribute to those institutions with their taxes.

Each institution has to set a number of their weekly/monthly upkeep, which is public. The institutions can also set specific funding targets for specific projects. And everyone should see what are the current projects of the institutions, their organization, their members, and how they spend all the money (since it’s all public in the ledger).

Each democracy votes the percentage of an [automated payment transaction tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Payment_Transaction_tax), and all the transactions of all the companies and people registered in that democracy are ensured to comply with it, by smart contracts.

Each institution is ranked by priority decided by the voting system. The taxes are always automatically directed to the unfunded intitutions, by the priority ranking, after one is funded, they start to go to the next. When all the required institutions are funded, the rest of the taxes collected automatically go to the democratic fund, and the community can then vote if it’s redirected to specific projects or organizations. Or we can create a local credit system based on that fund.

Payment wages to people in companies and organizations, along with a future basic income program, can all be programmed to be done automatically from the companies/organizations/democracies crypto wallets with the use of smart contracts.

Additionally those democracies could themselves be part of a higher order democracies to fund other regional-based institutions.

Since it’s all decentralized, the market would be ready to be used by any community just by registering in any place of the world. And in the future the communities can start to join forces within the same application.

## The Vegan Factor

The movement cannot work if we can’t convince people to start using the system for all their purchases.

By crafting a market of vegan food and products, where vegans can

A little background on the situation in my city:

> I live in Argentina, which is not a first world country, and as such vegans in my city struggle to find vegan products like tofu, tempeh, plant-based milks, pastry, donuts, fast food, cakes, meat replacements, egg replacements, yogurths, mayonnaise, soap, shampoo, ethically sourced clothes, cosmetics, and stuff like that, because you can't find it in supermarkets. There are some local entrepreneurs or small companies that provide these products in the market, but they distribute them inefficiently on health food stores, and sell through Facebook pages, it's a horrible system. However there is a local community already growing around these companies, and they regularly hold vegan food open markets where you can go and try all the city offerings.

> There is also the issue for knowing vegan food availability in local restaurants. Restaurants could register to display their vegan options, and form a local map of vegan offerings. With this, veganism becomes much easier to hop into, and each new vegan is a new citizen of the next system.

As you can see, this community already exists. And it would benefit greatly from a digital market with a distributing solution. Furthermore, the interests of the vegan community completely coincide with goal the essay portraits.

We can then create a cooperative distribution company that takes care of supplying the community with food from local farms, and ethically sourced goods, and it also acts as a centralized entity for the distribution of basic goods by delivery to the citizens. They of course buy the items from the distributing company, as they would buy from any other company in the digital market. And the customers pick how they want it delivered, or if they want to pick it up.

This allows vegans to save money on food and basic neccesities by buying it communally in bulk and removing supermarkets or stores from the equation, which should noticeably reduce the cost of living. And at the same time it empowers them to directly support vegan activism in their cities. Which are both incredible motivators to join the market.

With this we should then start to generate a consolidated stream of money that can then be invested to grow the system and the community.

## Volunteering

I’m a web developer, and I specilize in frontend, if it’s technically possible to do all the blockchain things required by this system through the Horizon API and Stellar smart contracts, then I can create the app as a pure static SPA and build it on Github.

I currently don’t know enough about Stellar or smart contracts to know if it’s possible with the current API. So I would really appreaciate the help of someone with more knowledge of crypto development.
